# Free_Cell_Game

The aim of this project is to create a solitaire based game clone in Python.

## Rules of the Game

1.	Only one card may be moved at a time.
2.	The four foundations must be built starting from the Ace of the appropriate suit, followed by the 2, then the 3 etc. until the King is placed.
3.	If a card is placed on a cascade, it must be placed of a card of the opposite colour, and of a suit that is one higher than itself.
4.	Any card may be placed in an empty cascade.
5.	Cards from the foundations may be placed back onto a cascade, or an empty cascade slot.
6.	Only one card at a time can occupy a cell slot.
7.	Victory is achieved when all four foundations are filled with their respective suits from Ace to King.
8.	A card can be placed into cascade by entering either the label name or the card which is desired to place on top of.
9.	A card can be placed into foundation and free cells by entering the label name.
